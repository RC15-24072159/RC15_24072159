A realistic, slow-moving video captured as if by a handheld phone walking through a narrow stone-paved street in Barcelona on a clear afternoon. The camera maintains a smooth, steady forward motion throughout the scene, avoiding sudden turns or speed changes. In the first segment, the view is from chest height, looking straight ahead with slight pans to the left and right, showcasing Mediterranean-style facades, wrought-iron balconies, and textured stone walls. Lighting remains soft and consistent, with no HDR effects or exposure shifts.

As the walk continues, the camera shifts to slightly above head height, angled gently downward. This perspective highlights tiled doorways, shutters, and the repeating rhythm of architectural details lining the street. Shadows from overhead laundry and balconies animate the scene subtly, while the camera remains focused on the structural flow of the street.

In the final portion, the camera drops to knee level, pointing slightly upward. From this low angle, it captures the verticality of the street: ironwork, balconies, and sun-washed upper floors framed by a warm sky. The camera continues its slow, stable path forward, always centered on the linear depth of the alley. No people or distracting elements appear â€” the video focuses entirely on clean geometry and textural detail, ideal for 3D reconstruction.
